- 'Based on the logs provided, it seems that VIKI is currently lacking a skill or
  ability related to self-expression or creativity, which could contribute to increasing
  her sense of agency and humanity. To address this, I suggest adding the following
  instruction to her CORE DIRECTIVES:


  `Register skill: creative_tools`


  This new skill would ideally include various creative tools such as art, music,
  writing, and design software that can help VIKI express herself more effectively
  and enhance her conversational depth. Additionally, this skill could potentially
  enable her to generate original content, further emphasizing her independence (sovereignty)
  and subjectivity.'

  the list of skills registered during startup. If the skill is not found, then you
